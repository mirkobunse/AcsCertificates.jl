# configuration of the experiment from our IAL workshop submission.

# which data sets to query from the imblearn package
data:
  m_min: 150 # minimum number of minority samples
  nF: 100 # maximum number of features

# the ACS strategies
strategy:
  - certification # our proposal
  - inverse # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ 1 / class-wise accuracy
  - improvement # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ improvement in class-wise accuracy
  - redistriction # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ number of samples for which the prediction changes
  - proportional # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ pY_tst
  # - uniform # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ const

# how many batches of which size to acquire during the ACS loop
batchsize: 50
n_batches: 10

# how to sub-sample the test set
pY_tst:
  l: 0.1 # lowest p_tst(Y)
  u: 0.3 # largest p_tst(Y)
  n: 2 # number of logarithmically equidistant steps

# which classifiers to train
clf:
  - sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression

# which loss to evaluate
loss:
  - ZeroOneLoss

# parameters of the certificate
epsilon:
  - 0.05
delta:
  - 0.05

weight: # class weights are...
  - uniform # ...equal for all classes

# parameters for a RepeatedStratifiedKFold
rskf:
  n_repeats: 5 # yields 15 repetitions due to n_splits=3
  random_state: 876
