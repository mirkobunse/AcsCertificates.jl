# configuration of the experiment from our IAL workshop submission.

# which data sets to query from the imblearn package
data:
  m_min: 150 # minimum number of minority samples
  nF: 100 # maximum number of features

# the ACS strategies
strategy:
  - certification # our proposal
  - inverse # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ 1 / class-wise accuracy
  - improvement # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ improvement in class-wise accuracy
  - redistriction # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ number of samples for which the prediction changes
  - proportional # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ pY_tst
  - proportional_estimate
  - uniform # Lomasky et al: utility ∝ const
